# Data Scraping Project

This Python project allows users to perform data scraping by specifying a website link and a CSS selector for the target element they want to scrape. The code retrieves the HTML content of the provided link, parses it using BeautifulSoup library, and extracts data based on the specified CSS selector.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- BeautifulSoup (`pip install beautifulsoup4`)
- Requests (`pip install requests`)
- Validators (`pip install validators`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.

2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the prerequisites section.

3. Run the script `scraping_project.py` in a Python environment.

4. Enter the website link when prompted. Make sure to provide a valid URL.

5. Enter the CSS selector for the target element. This selector specifies the HTML element(s) you want to scrape from the webpage. Refer to the CSS selector syntax and rules for correct usage.

6. The script will make an HTTP request to the provided URL, retrieve the HTML content, and extract the desired data based on the specified selector.

7. The scraped data will be displayed on the console.

Note: If no data is found for the specified selector, a message indicating the absence of data will be displayed.

## Examples

- Example 1:
  ```
  Enter website link here: https://www.example.com
  Enter the CSS selector for the target element: h1
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  Scraped data:
  Welcome to Example
  ```

- Example 2:
  ```
  Enter website link here: https://www.example.com
  Enter the CSS selector for the target element: .description
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  Scraped data:
  This is an example website.
  ```

## Acknowledgments

The code is built upon the BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries. Special thanks to the authors and contributors of these libraries for providing powerful tools for web scraping in Python.
